    title: 'iPhone 17 Ultra could be the next iPhone X moment',
    content:
      ' I still remember my first moments with an iPhone X. It felt like something from the future: the OLED display, Face ID, all-screen design, new UX paradigms for navigation.

Now a new report from The Information detailing what the high-end iPhone 17 will look like corroborates that the iPhone 16 Plus will be the last of its kind. The Plus size for iPhones debuted in 2022 with the iPhone 14 lineup as an option for customers wanting a larger display without having to upgrade to the high-end Pro model.

If true, the Plus version will have had three years of existence, just one more than the iPhone mini. The new report from The Information says the Plus replacement will be “significantly thinner” than current iPhones with other upgrades like a redesigned camera system, and be more expensive than the Pro Max.',
